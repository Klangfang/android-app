# This is the Klangfang Android Repository
## Listen, collect sounds, compose together.
Klangfang is a social sound editor that connects you to other people. Directly on your smartphone.

Record a few sounds, start a new composition and observe how it will get developed further by the community. Everyone will have exactly the same amount of space for their sounds. After 4 contributors, the composition is finished.

Klangfang is not published on the Play Store yet.
